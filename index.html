                                Paul had worked within the property market since he was 18. His successful career first started as an estate agent for independent agents as well as being the youngest branch manager in the country for one of the major corporate estate agency chains. He was then head-hunted by a top 100 global law firm to spearhead a new business development project created by Paul. He was then also headhunted by a well-known property portal to develop and launch its legal and financial section. <br> <br>

                                Paul then moved into business, marketing and media consultancy for the property, investments and finance industries. Paul then launched his own company in 2008 and PJPB Associates was born.

            Social media marketing is essential to the success of any online marketing effort in today’s world. Websites alone are not enough for success. ‘Social Media isn’t a fad, it’s a fundamental shift in the way that we communicate’. Allow us to form a partnership with your business to effectively leverage the social web through social media management. Our Team will develop creative strategies to build your online fan/follower basis, manage your social media PR and interact with potential clients on your behalf. <br> <br>
            Social Media is important for investment companies as it helps with their google rankings, online presence and to share their knowledge and expertise as a property professional. We will provide constant updates of social media, i.e. with property news, will ensure possible investors view the company as reliable and constantly aware of market trends. <br> <br>
            Social media allows for investors to be regularly updated of their investments. For example, pictures of construction progress can be shown to investors, this also makes other investors aware that you are delivering on your promises. Social media provides an interactive platform to update audiences on changes to your website i.e. the listing of new products, the publishing of new articles. Facebook allows for the posting of ‘events’ which is useful in the property world as you can make audiences aware of events your company will be attending in upcoming months. <br> <br>
            Using Google+ can reduce SEO spend, as any organic information published on there will immediately be bumped up on google search results.

            Over 80% of search results now contain AdWords ad placements and those placements can cover as much as 85% of the space above the fold on the results page.
            We set up and manage ad word campaigns. AdWords allows you to get up and running very quickly. As soon as your account is created and your ads are approved, they’ll start displaying in search results and your site will start receiving traffic. <br> <br>
            Pay-per-click campaigns can also provide you with vital data that can be used to plan your organic SEO campaigns. With AdWords, you’ll quickly know which keywords are able to drive the most traffic and which drive the most conversions. This will let you know what you should strive to rank for in the organic results. <br> <br>
            SEO is measurable – every campaign can be measured, calculated and corrected. Customers use social media, it was recently found 83% of UK online shoppers use search engines to research a purchase. It is important to invest heavily, as one position above your competitions in search results will instantly result in more customers coming to your website. The more your site is optimised, the better rankings in search engines, the more traffic you will generate and the more lead/sales you will get. There is a high drop off in click through rate between the first and second positions on the first page, so WE make sure you outrank your competitors.
